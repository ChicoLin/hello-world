Say hello to GitHub

I'm a master student in Carnegie Mellon University. I've taken quite a bit programming courses here in CMU and wrote (to some degree) a lot of codes and feel that I should find a good place to store and manage them as well as my future codes. So here I am in GitHub! Hope this will be a enjoyable site for me. LOL.

Cloud Computing, Computer Graphics, Data Structure, Computer Systems, Engineering Computation... More coming...
